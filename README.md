# pokemon-generation-1-scrape
This notebook creates a spreadsheet with the name, stats, and moves from the first pokemon games
It contains data cleaning in pandas and regular python combined with web scraping.
The data comes from https://pokemondb.net/move/generation/1 (for the attacks),
https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/all (for the name and stats), and the inspiration for this notebook came from 
https://towardsdatascience.com/web-scraping-html-tables-with-python-c9baba21059.

Enjoy!
